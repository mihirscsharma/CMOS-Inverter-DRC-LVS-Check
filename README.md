# DRC & LVS check
This lab helps set up the FreePDK45 process design kit, creating schematics and layouts, and performing DRC and LVS checks using Calibre. It also integrates HSPICE model files for simulations. The workflow follows a tutorial adapted from Brown University, with a focus on building an inverter, simulating its behavior, and verifying its layout against design rules and schematic connectivity.
